Trixie update guide.


Before
    1. Update to latest release of Bookworm
    2. Comment out Bookworm backports from apt sources
    3. Remove/update any user added sources (e.g changing the docker added source to use trixie instead of bookworm)
    4. Disable apt pinning
    4. Disable any watchdog(s)
    5. Run trixie upgrade in screen/tmux

After:
    1. Make sure systemd-cryptsetup is installed BEFORE rebooting if using an encrypted filesystem or anything to do with encrypted drives
    1. Re-enable trixie backports to apt sources
    2. Enable watchdog(s)
    3. Check kernel version, remove old kernels and make sure you've got the latest kernel metapackage
    3. List and remove any obsolete packages using apt list '~o' and apt purge '~o'
    3. run apt autoremove and apt clean
    3. Clean out old /tmp files located on disk by bind mounting the system and deleting. mount --bind / /mnt
    3. check if wtmpdb is installed and if not, remove the old /var/log/wtmp* log file
    3. Remove /etc/tmpfiles.d/tmp.conf if present in order to adopt the new systemd-tmpfiles auto-clean scheme that's default on new installations
    3. Switch to deb822 apt sources format, either manually or using apt modernize-sources
    4. Switch to Debian APT CDN sources if using mirrors
    3. Verify that timeshift works.
    4. Verify grub-btrfs works.


Notable changes:
    wcurl replacement for wget.

Fixes for common issues during upgrade:
    1. E: Could not perform immediate configuration on 'package'. Please see man 5 apt.conf under APT::Immediate-Configure for details.
        Fix: run apt full-upgrade -o APT::Immediate-Configure=0

    2. Sometimes it’s necessary to enable the APT::Force-LoopBreak option in APT to be able to temporarily remove an essential package due to a Conflicts/Pre-Depends loop. apt will alert you of this and abort the upgrade. You can work around this by specifying the option -o APT::Force-LoopBreak=1 on the apt command line.

    3.During an upgrade from the local console, the view may switch (e.g., when the display manager restarts). To return, press Ctrl+Alt+F1 in graphical mode or Alt+F1 in text mode, replacing F1 with the terminal number used. You can also switch between text consoles with Alt+←/→.
